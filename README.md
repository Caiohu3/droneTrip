# Walk Through Solution ☕️

This C# code implements a kind of greedy algorithm to optimize drone deliveries by efficiently assigning packages to drones. It begins by parsing input data from a file, extracting details about drones and delivery locations. The algorithm then iteratively selects the best drone for each delivery based on its weight capacity, assigns packages to minimize the number of trips.

The main logic involves iteratively assigning packages to drones, prioritizing heavier drones to minimize the overall number of trips. The code intelligently selects the best drone for each trip, respecting weight constraints and ensuring efficient package deliveries. The implementation also includes helper functions for extracting location and drone information, contributing to the overall clarity and modularity of the code.

You will notice that the output is different but have the same Efficieancy usage of the drones.
